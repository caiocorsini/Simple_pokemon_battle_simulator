# Simple_pokemon_battle_simulator
A simple battle simulator of a Pokémon 1v1 battle

This a 1v1 Pokémon battle simulator containing:
- A system for including Pokémon and moves, which are stored as objects in CSV files
- The user can save and load these files so that they don't have to input all Pokémon and moves again
- It is only a 1v1 battle. Other forms of Pokémon battle such as 6v6 and doubles are not available yet
- It contains type effectiveness, STABs, accuracy and critical hits

To be added soon...
- improve speed mechanic. For now, the user Pokémon always outspeeds the opponent without taking speed stat into account. This will soon be fixed.
